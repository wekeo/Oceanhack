# Oceanhack

The event is a one-of-a-kind gathering of data scientists, web/app developers, UX and UI designers, visionaries/space enthusiasts, marketing wizards and business developers, project managers and field experts to create solutions to 
problems that currently affect the Baltic Sea, and beyond to help people in their daily lives in this beautiful region. 

Copernicus OceanHack is funded by the EUâ€™s Copernicus Programme and has been organised through a partnership of EUMETSAT, the Copernicus Marine Environment Service, and the Estonian Environment Agency.
